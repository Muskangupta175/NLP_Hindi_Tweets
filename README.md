This project utilizes a Hindi Twitter tweets dataset. The dataset comprises of tweets containing hashtags, email IDs, emojis, and Hindi texts written in English language. 
Data cleaning procedures were implemented to analyze the content of sarcasm in the tweets, classifying them into two categories: Sarcastic and Non-sarcastic.
Classification of these tweets has been done using Pre-trained Transformer models. Multilingual models are used which are pre-trained on Hindi texts. These models are fine-tuned using our Hindi database.
