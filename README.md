Data cleaning procedures were implemented to analyze the content of sarcasm in the tweets, classifying them into two categories: Sarcastic and Non-sarcastic.
Classification of these tweets has been done using various Machine learning models. Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Xgboost were employed to perform classification of the tweets. 
Results have been curated with result metrics like Training and Test accuracy, Classification Report which includes Precision, Recall, F1 score and Confusion Matrix.
